# ////
# About the perl block..
# It's just a decompression, recursively.
# and the concluding .. eval saucer executes the self decompressed code.
# the decompression, funnily enough, isn't 
# that bad. also the compression.
# it's about 50 percent, sometime also more, 70 percent.
# denpends on the input, obviously.
# and it's only usable for ascii texts, 0x20-0x7e
# On the other hand, the decompression thorughput might succeed
# all other bottlenecks, so this isn't that useless.
# just a simple byte pair encoding, anyways.
# 
# Coding means art to me.
# Albite, I don't know what 'art' is.
# Me, my living? this might be about "art", not 'art'.
# I don't know it.
# Quite often I feel more attracted by music, crating
# music of my own.
#
# What's this all about?
#
# Is there a difference, is there a connection?
#
