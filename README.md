A passionated opensource developer, 
having fun with minimizing a statically linked 
Linux conglomeration.<br>
<!--Eventually I should set myself some reasonable limit,<br>
64kB (without kernel) seems to be possible, but there won't be much space left for manuals an other useful things.<br>
<br>-->
<br>
Started programming with Basic, to head on to Pascal, later Cpp, some Java, to finally go back to C and Assembly.
<br>
Did play with sql, css, html, and such.<br>
<br>
Currently mainly interested in shrinking binaries. Sort of competitive fun.<br><br>
<!--
Sometimes wondering about the development of IT - instead of getting "better", in the meaning of faster and being able to be more productive -
there seems to be a shiny interface more worth, than just being useful.<br>
At least for text processing, and development..<br><br>-->

 Oh freddled gruntbuggly,
Thy micturations are to me, (with big yawning)
As plurdled gabbleblotchits, in midsummer morning
On a lurgid bee,
That mordiously hath blurted out,
Its earted jurtles, grumbling
Into a rancid festering confectious organ squealer.
(Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz: Collected Poetry)

<em>
Now the jurpling slayjid agrocrustles,
Are slurping hagrilly up the axlegrurts,
And living glupules frart and stipulate,
Like jowling meated liverslime,
Groop, I implore thee, my foonting turlingdromes,
And hooptiously drangle me,
With crinkly bindlewurdles,mashurbitries.
Or else I shall rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon,
See if I don't! </em>(Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz: Collected Poetry)
